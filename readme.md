Gold Mine
=========

You can read about the game here [http://politaire.com/help/goldmine](http://politaire.com/help/goldmine).

- The game starts with all the cards in the stock (top left).
- Clicking on the stock moves 3 cards to the waste (element next to the stock).
- You can then move the last card there to either the tableau of the foundation.
- There's only one pass through the stock, so you need to keep combining the cards until you move through all the cards available.
- You can move any card to an empty tableau (bottom), or move to a stack there if a card is of alternating color and one value lower.
- The goal of the game is to move all the cards to the foundation (top right).
- A card may be moved to a foundation is its either an ace, or a card of the same suit with one higher value.
- So basically, keep combining the cards in the tableau (bottom), try not to use all the available empty tableaus (they are useful to make the combinations).
- As possible, you need to keep filling the foundation as well, starting with the ace and going from there.
- If you manage to move all the cards to the foundation (four stacks from ace to king) then you'll win the game.
